Dark brown hair, middle-parted, smooth and slightly wavy, falling over her shoulders. Her hands are gently folded in front of her, one resting over the other. She wears a dark, modest Renaissance dress with soft fabric folds and muted tones. The background is a distant atmospheric landscape with winding paths, rivers, rocky hills, and soft blue-green mountains fading into haze. Lighting is soft and diffused, with smooth transitions between light and shadow (sfumato), no harsh edges. Warm natural tones, delicate shading, highly detailed, realistic anatomy, classical 16th-century Italian painting style, oil on wood panel texture, subtle craquelure.",
